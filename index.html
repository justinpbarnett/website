            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working at <strong>Passion City Church</strong> in Atlanta, GA,
                where I build web and mobile applications using Vue, Laravel, Kotlin, C#, and Kubernetes. I focus on
                creating scalable, user-focused solutions that serve our church community.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background spanning XR development, full-stack software engineering, and construction
                management, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving—combining technical expertise with
                hands-on implementation skills.

            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Passion City Church</strong>, I develop full-stack applications that support our ministry
                operations and connect with our community. I work across the entire stack—from Vue-based frontends
                to Laravel APIs, Kotlin mobile apps, C# services, and Kubernetes deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the side, I'm building <strong>Prepared Citizen Corps</strong>, where I develop tactical technology
                solutions including WARLOCK—an AR digital night vision and HUD helmet system.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I've spent years in XR development—building virtual reality training systems, leading development teams,
                and educating developers through my YouTube channel with over 3 million views. I also have experience
                in construction management, which gave me hands-on problem-solving skills that inform my approach to
                both software and hardware projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a degree in Software Engineering and have worked
                with companies ranging from startups to enterprise clients, delivering everything from multiplayer
                VR experiences to AI-powered web applications to cloud-native ministry tools.
